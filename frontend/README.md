# Frontend

## Info
The frontend uses [Angular](https://angular.io/) for rendering and routing. The db facade lives `/src/app/services`.

## Local Development
First run `npm install` in the `frontend` directory. After that is finished, run `ng serve` to start a local development server. Visit 
`localhost:8080` to see the page.
